# StoneshardMods
data.win files for various mods (and combinations of mods) for the absolutely awesome game, Stoneshard.
For now all mods are for the beta version 0.5.8.8.
Choose the file which contains the combination of mods you want, then download it.
Locate your Stoneshard folder (steam install will have it in your steam library directory steamapps/common/Stoneshard).
Replace data.win with the modded version.

So far I haven't uploaded anything that has any bugs I'm aware of (obviously) and there shouldn't be any issues with compatability.
Yet.
